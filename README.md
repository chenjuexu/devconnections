## Live demo

Live demo of the app is hosted on Heroku.  
Visit [https://devconnect-chen.herokuapp.com](https://devconnect-chen.herokuapp.com)

Test user credentials:

> login - _user2@mail.com_  
> password - _123456_

_Due to demo reasons and heroku free terms, if an app receives no web traffic in a 30-minute period, it will sleep. Therefore, during the first launch, the application may take longer to load than usual, approximately 15 - 20 seconds. So please be patient and wait for the app to launch. Subsequent launches will be relatively fast._
